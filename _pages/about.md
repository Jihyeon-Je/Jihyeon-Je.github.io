I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Leo Guibas. I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical/Computer Engineering, and Computer Science from Duke University. I am interested in extracting hidden geometric structures that underlie complex data, particularly at the intersection of computer graphics, geometry/structure processing, and content creation. Previously, I have had the privilege of closely working with Kyle Lafata at Duke, Zachary Kaplan at Schr√∂dinger, and Beth Cimini at the Imaging Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I was also fortunate enough to have worked with Minhyuk Sung and his Geometric AI group at KAIST. I am a proud alumni of Wolfram Summer School.

In my free time, I like to read, run, explore good restaurants, and rewatch Gilmore Girls. I also love playing video games (I like to think it's part of my research).
