I am a second year <b>Computer Science</b> Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by <a href="https://geometry.stanford.edu/"><b>Prof. Leonidas Guibas</b></a> and <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/"><b>Prof. Maneesh Agrawala</b></a>. I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical/Computer Engineering, and Computer Science from Duke University. 
                                   
I am interested in extracting hidden geometric structures that underlie complex data, particularly at the intersection of computer graphics, geometry/structure processing, and content creation.  

Previously, I have had the privilege of closely working with <a href="https://www.kylelafata.com/"><b>Kyle Lafata</b></a> at <b>Duke</b>, <a href="https://zakaplan.com/"><b>Zachary Kaplan</b></a> at <b>Schr√∂dinger</b>, and <a href="https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/"><b>Beth Cimini</b></a> at the Imaging Platform of the <b>Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</b>.
I was also fortunate enough to have worked with <a href="https://mhsung.github.io/"><b>Minhyuk Sung</b></a> and his Geometric AI group at <b>KAIST</b>.
I am a proud alumni of <a href="https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school/alumni/2018/"><b>Wolfram Summer School</b></a>.

In my free time, I like to read, run, explore good restaurants, and rewatch Gilmore Girls. I also love playing video games (I like to think it's part of my research). 

Please reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating or just want to chat!
